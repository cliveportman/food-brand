### Description
The left-hand button has various levels of text (Paragraph, Heading 1-6).
We are only using Heading 2 and Paragraphs. You can create line-breaks without starting a new paragraph by using a soft-return. On Windows, that's CTRL+ENTER. On a Mac, it's probably CMD+ENTER.

### Tags
We use the tags for two things:
1. The background colour of the product page.
2. Ingredients and Nutrition Info.

For the background colour, your options are `orange`, `yellow`, `teal` and `red`. These are the only tags we're prepared for so don't use any other colours. They should be lower-case and spelt correctly.

For the Ingredients and Nutrition Info, the tags are a shortened version of the flavour, all in lowercase. In the Nutrition Info and Ingredients templates we look for this tag and display the appropriate details. These tags must match the tags used in the `Snippets > NutritionInfo.liquid` and `Snippets > Ingredients` templates in the theme's code editor.

### Editing the code
Go to `Online Store > Themes` and nfind the current theme's Actions button. Click on that and select Edit Code.
I strongly recommend you duplicate the current theme and give the duplicate a good name. Have a look at the names I've used. Then make your changes to the duplicate before publishing the duplicate to be your store's theme.
