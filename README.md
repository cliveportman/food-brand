### Frontend
Svelte JS main page hosted and deployed via Netlify. Shopify theme developed to match the main site.

### Backend
Shopify for handling the cart and checkout process.

## Who was the client?
An existing client of the design agency, wanting to launch a new product line.

## Technical challenges
The design-spec was quite tight but little thought had been given to the implementation and the budget was tight. I began with some design consultancy to better manage expectations and proposed we use Shopify to provide the ecommerce functionality, but with a non-Shopify main page. This allowed us to deliver a high-quality site on a tight budget.
